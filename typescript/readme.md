hello, to start the page simply open the index.html file.

also live server extension can be used to open the page as well. I have used this extension on the vscode -> ritwickdey.LiveServer


for editing or updating, app.ts file is the target. after the changes simply use this command ( tsc app.ts ) to compile the app.ts file
